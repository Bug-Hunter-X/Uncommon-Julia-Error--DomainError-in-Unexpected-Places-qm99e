```julia
function myfunction(x)
  if x > 0
    return x^2
  else
    return -x^2
  end
  # This function will throw a DomainError if x is complex
  # because the `^` operator is not defined for complex numbers with negative base and non-integer exponent
  # This is an uncommon error that is often missed
  return sqrt(x)
  # This function will throw a DomainError if x is negative 
  # because the square root is not defined for negative numbers
  # This is another uncommon error that is often missed

end
